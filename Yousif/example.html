    OVERALL FEEDBACK

    I think you'll agree that your project is kinda sparse and messy right now, and I imagine it's hard to know where to revise, add things, subtract, change, etc. I highly recommend dedicating this week to starting it over from scratch. It sounds daunting, but you have ideas to draw upon, so you're not starting from scratch there.

    Also, be sure to work on those images.

    Be sure to use the resources from the readings + the handouts, such as the HTML Reference Guide. I think that'll help you develop your structure.

    Furthermore, be sure to clean up your project. For example, your 'Assets' folder needs to be all lowercase. Your images folder should be inside of the assets folder, and you have a 'web1.html' file.

    Remember that we're focusing on big structure/landmarks, so most pages will include the following example structure with varied subparts within them of course. I hope this helps you take the time this week to get caught up before the midterm and especially our CSS unit. You'll fall behind quite a bit, if you're not hip to some of these HTML concepts and techniques.
