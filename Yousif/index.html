           Electrical Engineering
           <p>"The creativity of electrical engineers has revolutionized our world. They create the methods and devices to detect, gauge, 
              transform, transmit, manage, and receive both energy and information. In their work, electrical engineers tackle projects ranging 
              from  tiny robots the size of mosquitoes to overseeing enormous structures spanning millions of miles, like the country's power 
              network"

           <p>
            "The aerospace engineering program covers topics such as aerodynamics, flight dynamics and controls, propulsion, and aerospace 
            structures. It concludes with a senior-level design sequence that is nationally recognized, focusing on the analysis and design of 
            aircraft, spacecraft, and associated technologies."
