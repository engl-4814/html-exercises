  <!-- ALLY COMMENTS
    - Main's role is not region. Double check your work here.
    - Looks like your using region everywhere. Please make sure to review the readings, as they even have helpful guides and tabulated terms and definitions for these role attributes. My slides also review how to implement the labels.
    - Throughout check how you're using aria-labelledby, since its incorrect.

           Electrical Engineering
           <p>"The creativity of electrical engineers has revolutionized our world. They create the methods and devices to detect, gauge, 
              transform, transmit, manage, and receive both energy and information. In their work, electrical engineers tackle projects ranging 
              from  tiny robots the size of mosquitoes to overseeing enormous structures spanning millions of miles, like the country's power

       Engineering can be a very daunting field, but with the right planning and studying 
       I strongly believe anyone would be able to succeed in this field.
