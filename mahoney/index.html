    Overall Feedback

    - It's tough to give feedback without content at this point. Be sure to catch up this week before the midterm. LMK what questions you have. Here's some advice to help you move forward:

    1. Note you you have open and closed your body. All of your content goes inside of the body element.
    2. the closing tag for the html root element will always be the last closing tag on the page, since it contains ALLTHETHINGS.
    3. You have a lot going on with no content, so I think you've led yourself astray a bit. I would just restart for simplicity. Start with the first thing that needs to be in the body: the skip link. Then, is it your header? Then your nav? Then your main? Then, what landmarks are children of the main?
    4. You've missnamed numerous elements below. The browser won't tell you that there's something wrong, but your screenreader testing will. Be sure to use my provided resources and review the readings. For example, there's an HTML5 element resource sheet that would have helped you catch lots of those misnamed elements. I think your missign attendance early on might have made it difficult for you, so be sure to dedicate some time this week to this class. It will be super important, as we move forward quite quickly. I want you to understand HTML fundamentals before we startup CSS next week.
