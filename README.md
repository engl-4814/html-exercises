# html-exercises repo

Students will work within their respective folders to complete the coding assignments by following these instructions:

1. Name your lastname as the name of the folder. Within `html-exercises`, create a folder and name it with your lastname using all lowercase characters â€” **NO UPPERCASE PURDY PLEASE**.

    * **EXAMPLE**: My folder will be named `lindgren`

2. Within your folder, create an `html` file named `index.html`.

    * NOTE: Again, **NO UPPERCASE PURDY PLEASE**. Only use lowercase characters.

Now, you should have created the following folder and file with the following path structure. I will use my lastname as an example: `html-exercises/lindgren/index.html`.

Submit your work by comitting and pushing your code to the repository. Then, notify me via Canvas by submitting a completion notification for that assignment.
