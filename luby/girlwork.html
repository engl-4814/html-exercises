                    </figure>
                        <p>Zefyr Lisowski’s second book is a journey of physical and emotional growth as a woman navigates the labors of girlhood and the ghosts of sexual violence to free herself from the cage of the past. Featuring a narrative interspersed with vignettes and addresses to herself, past predators, and readers, Girl Work chronicles the pains of the pursuit of perfection and identity and the aching wound of unacknowledged traumas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lisowski guides readers through consensual and non-consensual sexual encounters using sensory snapshots. Evocative sensory experiences highlight the sharp memory and sexual dissociation common in the aftermath of traumatic events. Predators become mouths in a smokey apartment, shiny teeth and a billowing cape, movies playing on a screen, and “take it.” Partners become the smell of lavender, the taste of peppermint, and the sound of Tom Petty on the stereo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The emotional absence of the subject’s father shades her perception of fatherhood. She resents her father for his ignorance and lack of action and sees every predatory man as someone’s future father:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My father didn’t do anything, but that is my point—how we are
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            haunted and haunt everything closest to us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How many fathers did.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My clothes were gray. My clothes were green. My clothes were
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            a distant mountain. I didn’t want to write about a father, but a
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            future father’s tongue is in my mouth like a pufferfish and my
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            jaw won’t stop pop-popping open.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Isn’t it funny. He wasn’t my father, but someday he would be
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            someone’s. That’s how the equation works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Psychological scars from a prior assault are unveiled through flashes from the movie The Ring. Glimpses of well holes and dripping water haunt her inescapably, paralleling Samara’s prison, “She moves around, but she’s still at the bottom of the well.” When she finally escapes her cage, she is transformed:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When she clatters up the walls of the well,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            when she appears again in front of the man who killed her,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m sure she looks
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            beautiful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lisowski captures the juxtaposition of girlhood in the contradiction of beauty as a blessing and a curse. Beauty is something to seek, a currency to earn by cramming yourself into its frame, “The more I punish myself, the more beauty I am allowed.” Beauty is also something to reject, something forced onto people, “I do not wish to be beautiful, but it has been done to me anyway.” It can be dangerous, tempting, and violent: 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By “beauty” I mean that which
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            causes you to become an object of fascination, and sometimes to
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            be thrown into a well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the final entry, “Poem Only About Girl Work,” the girl has shed her pursuit of perfection and has escaped the prison of her own well, seeing the world through clear lenses:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m here. I’m alive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m in the bathroom
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            looking at you, mirror,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            flesh bright and unbruised
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            against the frame—
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            air crisp as well water,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            held
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            unpretty at last,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            by the great,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            fucked,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            flawed beauty
