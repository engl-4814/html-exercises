        This is Invictus, my tiefling bard character. I didn't draw that, though I wish I did. I figured I'd tell you about what I wish I'd been doing this week as opposed to more of what I actually did. If it isn't obvious, what I wish I was doing was playing Dungeons and Dragons. Sadly, my group won't be finishing our year-long campaign together before I and the DM graduate. (I hope you are the professor that mentioned they like DnD, otherwise this is awkward...and confusing. Sorry in advance!)

        <h2>Why tielfings make AMAZING bards:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A race-based charisma bonus. Some even get dexterity bonuses depending on which kind you play!</li>
                <li>Extra cantrips! Even some other at-will race based spells. </li>
                <li>SO. MUCH. FLAVOR. The plotlines write themselves- are they misunderstood due to their race and mischeivious nature, but secretly a hero? Are they evil but great at hiding it due to their bardic expertise? How do people in the world react to them, and how has it shaped them? </li>
            </ul>
         <p>If you aren't convinced, I provided even more reasons in another unordered list below. (I totally didn't make this super similar to the first page and make another two lists for visual cohesion or anything)</p>
         <p>There's even more:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>I am taking this bullet point as an opportunity to continue freaking out about how well this character could feed into a grander storyline.</li>
                <li>The rogue/bard multiclassing opportunities here are CRAZY. </li>
                <li>You just cannot tell me you couldn't write a character off of the image above.</li>
             </ul>

    </div>

<p>Now that that's over, I really hope you enjoyed reading my site. It is not very sleek, but that is by design- I wanted it to be a humorous break from what I imagine is monotonous grading work otherwise. I understand the CSS needs work even now, but I genuinely tried and referenced past assignments as well. I hope this is acceptable work, and I hope that I can ultimately pass this class and graduate (noted: 18 credit hours and two jobs are NOT a good combo). Thank you so much for an amazing semester! </p>
