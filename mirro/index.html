        OVERALL FEEDBACK

        Simple, but ok so far. Keep it up! You got this! :-)

        - Need to implement landmarks with ARIA roles and labels throughout. Right now, you have an implicit structure defined by your heading levels, but you need to make this structure more specific with scoped out landmarks: header, nav, main, section, footer, etc.

    <h1>This is the Home Page of my Site. </h1>
    <p>Text that gets the viewer excited.</p>

        IMAGES
        - Definitely need to be sure to incorporate more images with the srcset/3 versions of the same file.
        - Needs the OG 'src' attribute, as well as the 'width' and 'height' attributes.

    <!-- PARAGRAPHS & PLACEHOLDER TEXT: Remember that you can use placeholder text for your paragraphs and any other longer set of content, such as blockquotes, etc. I also recommend structuring your paragraphs like the inserted example paragraph below. If you do so, you can close them up via VS Code's nice feature. -->
