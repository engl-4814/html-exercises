        <p> I've decided to turn this into a virtual journal in the final hour. Please proceed to read my thoughts, formatted using my basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Check out the other page of my site too! </p>

        This used to be my image placeholder until I got kinda fond of it. Thinking it looks cute now that it's actually formatted properly, even if it is VERY 2014. Anyways, I said I was turning this into a journal. Soooo...

            <h2>Here's what's been going on the past week:</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Picked up everything I'm wearing for graduation!</li>
                <li>I worked MANY hours but my boss bought me lunch</li>
                <li> Chick-Fil-A runs between cram sessions (peak hokie experience)</li>
             </ul>
         <p> Overall, it was a week that got me very hype for graduation (senioritis is just a rebranded version of burnout and no one can prove me wrong)</p>
        </div>
     <strong>BUT WAIT</strong>
    <div>
     <p>That's not all I did:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Bought letters to decorate my stole at Hobby Lobby</li>
         <li>Ate dominoes for dinner three nights in a row (wow!)</li>
         <li> Pray that I actually get all the credits I need to pass (certified senior moment) ((This is the only class I am worried about, I am a nearly straight A student PLEASE gimme at least a C- I'm begging))</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>What a week!</p>

     <h3>/SRS: Some Additional Thoughts</h3>
         <p> My college years were some of the most difficult years of my life. As a senior, I look into my unwritten future with excitement, but also a great deal of fear. Very few people prepare you for the intimidating feeling of starting all over again after college- a new city, new people, and a new lifestyle. I've always had a clear plan laid out before me, but now I possess a frightening level of freedom. I did it when I came to Blacksburg, so I know I am capable. I know it will bring good things, but I have also grown so attached to the things I have worked so hard ot create in Blacksburg. This became home. I pray that I have learned how to plant myself in good soil, and I pray that what is meant for me finds me, as well as my peers. </p>
    <strong>Anyways!</strong>
