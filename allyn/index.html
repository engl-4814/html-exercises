            <h3>Current Status</h3>
                <p>
                 I am a Junior at Virginia Tech studying Agribusiness Management with a minor in both Organizational Leadership and Professional and Technical Writing. I plan to graduate from Virginia Tech in May 2025. Upon my graduation, I aspire to attend law school with a specialization in agricultural law. In order to work towards this goal, I am currently an undergraduate research assistant working on extension publications regarding land leasing. Aside from education, I own and show registered Holstein dairy cattle all over North America alongside my parents, owners and operators of Allyndale Holsteins. I take part in daily management, show preperation, breeding selection, and marketing/sale.

            <h4>How I Created This Site</h4>
                <p>
                 As mentioned apart of my education, I have a minor in Professional and Technical Writing. I enrolled in a Online Developement course Spring 2024 and was tasked with creating a website using html. Being completely alien to any coding content, I am growing my experience and skills with html and technological accessability.
