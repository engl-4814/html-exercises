    Nice nav!

    One suggestion: Flip your structure a smidge, so that not everything in it is considered a "Navigation menu"; specifically, that div. Consider the following instead:

    div class="top_bar_container"
      - nav
        - ul
          - ...
      div class="logo_container"
        - h1
        - img

    The structure above better defines hte scope of the nav menu.

But, the div here is just doing what the header is doing. Later, perhaps, you'll come back to this and realize that you might want to organize the headings from the img with two divs. Allthistosay, you'll be revising this later, based on the design you want to achieve, i.e., I'm splitting some hairs right now. You're doing great! :-) -->

        An estimated 2.2 million orthopedic procedures involving bone grafts are performed annually worldwide. While small breaks can heal on their own, severe injuries cannot and require surgical intervention. Current solutions, such as autologous and allogenic grafts, have inherent limitations due to supply and risks associated with disease. Goldstein's research group aims to create a bioactive, tissue engineered scaffold &#40;TENGS&#41; that will aid in the regeneration process and overcome current challenges. Current projects investigate poly&#40;1,8 octane-diol&#41; co-citric acid, polyurethanes, and poly&#40;glycerol sebacate&#41;. We are creating 3-dimensional TENGS in addition to micro-fibrous meshes for varying orthopedic applications. Once the scaffols are fabricated, the students are able to test their mechanical, biological, and chemical properties using methods such as tensile tests, DSC, cell culturing, etc.

      <!--what is the proper way to add citations??-->
      <!-- Personally, I argue that it's unordered list items. I've seen others parse each citation as a paragraphI can share some css later too. -->
