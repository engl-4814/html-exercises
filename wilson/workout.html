        According to Marriam-Webster the definition of workingout is "a practice or exercise to test or improve one's fitness for athletic competition, ability, or performance."

       <h2 id="Splits">Splits</h2> 
         <p> 
            A split is a routine that you choose to follow to target a certain area on your body. You should have a minimum of once a week as a rest day. The split that I use is as follows.
            <p>
                Monday- Push day (chest and shoulders)<br>
                Tuesday- Leg day<br>
                Wednesday- Pull day (back and bicepts)<br>
                Thursday- Glute focused legs<br>
                Friday- Ab day<br>
                Saturday- Whole body<br>
                Sunday- Rest<br>
            </p>
            Choosing a routine that works for you is tricky. It will take a lot of trial and error but in the end will be worth it. A general rule of thumb is to aim for 6-8 reps per set. If you are doing more reps per set you should up the weight to you are doing Progressive Overload. Defined as "a principle of resistance training exercise program design that typically relies on increasing load to increase neuromuscular demand to facilitate further adaptations." Aim for 3-5 sets for each workout.

        <h3 id="what to do"> What to do </h3>
            <p>
                I will typically do 4 sets at the maximum weight I can do for around 6 reps. For my 5th and final set I will drop the weight and do a drop set and push myself until failure on a light weight.
                <ol>

                    <li> For a whole body day you will be using any of the listed items from the past days and hit them ever so slightly. You do not want to hit them too hard as you will be doing so many different exercises and hitting all aspects of your body.</li>
                    <li> Rest day is one of the most important days. Your musscules need time to rest and recharge so you will be able to work them out again. You are intentinally shreding your musscules to build them up so therefore need time to get back together.</li>
