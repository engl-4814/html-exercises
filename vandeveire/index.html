        I know you took this class before, but remember that this needs to go inside of a stylesheet.
        Be sure to create the following:
            1. an 'assets' folder in your root folder.
            2. Create a .keep file inside the assets folder.
            3. Move the 'images' and 'favicon' folders inside of 'assets'
            4. Create a 'css' folder inside of 'assets'
            5. Create a 'style.css' file inside of 'css'.

        Also, what are the 'index_page1.html' and 'index_page2.html' files? If they're additional planned pages, then rename them according to the main topic. 'index' is reserved for the main .html file in a folder.

        ATTRIBUTE FORMATTING
        - Close up the spaces between the equals sign and the attribute and its value.

        CONTENT FORMATTING
        - Close up those whitespaces after opening tags and before the closing tags:
            - Ex: <span> health_and_safety </span> should be <span>health_and_safety</span>

        INLINE STYLING
        - Remove all of them. It's nasty to deal with the 'cascade' if you are using them. They are mainly used with interaction/JavaScript.

            <h2 class="section-margin"> Knee Rehabilitation for Health and Safety </h2>
            <p class="paragraph-indent"> This article highlights key components to strengthen and stretch your knee muscles to promote recovery and prevent future injuries. If you’re recovering from a knee injury or surgery, a well-structured knee conditioning program can help you regain strength, flexibility, and range of motion. The following content are some key points to consider: </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-margin"> Strength Training: </h3>
            <p class="paragraph-indent"> Strengthening the muscles that support your knee is crucial. Strong muscles reduce stress on the knee joint and help absorb shock. Focus on the following muscle groups: </p> 
            <ul> 
                <li> <p> Hamstrings </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Quadtracepts </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Abductors & Adductors </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Gluteus medius & Gluteus maximus </p> </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-margin"> Flexibility </h3>
            <span class="paragraph-indent"> Stretching the muscles you strengthen is essential for restoring range of motion and preventing injury. After strength exercises, gently stretch to reduce muscle soreness and maintain flexibility. </span>


            <h3 class="subsection-margin"> Warmup </h3>
            <p class="paragraph-indent"> Before starting exercises, warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of low-impact activity like walking or stationary cycling. </p>
            

            <h3 class="subsection-margin"> Exercises: </h3>
            <ol> 
                <h4> Helcord Stretch: </h4>
                <li> <p> Stand facing a wall with your unaffected leg forward and a slight bend at the knee. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Your affected leg should be straight and behind you, heel flat and toes slightly pointed inward. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Press your hips forward toward the wall, keeping both heels flat on the floor. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, then relax for 30 seconds. Repeat. </p> </li>
            </ol>

            <ol> 
                <h4> Standing Quadtracepts Stretch: </h4>
                <li> <p> Hold on to the back of a chair or a wall for balance. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Stretch the front of your thigh by bending your knee and bringing your heel toward your buttocks. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Hold for 30 seconds, then relax. Repeat. </p> </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="subsection-margin"> Injury Breakdown: </h3>
            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> 1. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injury: </h4>
            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> The ACL is one of the ligaments connecting the shinbone to the thighbone. ACL injuries often occur during sports that involve sudden changes in direction (e.g., basketball, soccer). </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> 2. Fractures: </h4>
            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> The bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can break due to falls or accidents. Osteoporosis can weaken bones, making them susceptible to fractures even from minor trauma. </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> 3. Torn Meniscus: </h4>
            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> The meniscus is rubbery cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between the shinbone and thighbone. Sudden twisting of the knee while bearing weight can tear the meniscus, leading to pain and limited mobility. </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> 4. Sprained or Strained Knee Ligaments and Muscles: </h4>
            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> These injuries often result from trauma or overuse. Ligaments and muscles can become sprained or strained, causing pain, swelling, and instability. </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> 5. Tendonitis: </h4>
            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> Inflammation of tendons around the knee can cause discomfort. Overuse, repetitive movements, or underlying conditions contribute to tendonitis </p>


            <h3 class="subsection-margin"> Common Injuries: </h3>

            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> Patellar Tendonitis</h4>
