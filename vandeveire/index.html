    <p> I know this is likely the last time you will see my website and it would be quite bizarre to not submit my current changes to receive as much credit as possible. However, with this class in particular, I struggle pushing updates when its not aligned with where I envisioned it to be. Its a needless crutch which causes constant setbacks because I cant refer to any previous version but this is the life i chose to live. Hopefully the basic outline of techniques and learning objectives could potentially satisfy some of the things your looking for. </p>

      <h3> Overview </h3>
      <p> The purpose of this website is to look back on all my courses and create sort of an achrive for all the notes, homeworks, and projects. It wouldnt be feasible to get all my classes in here. Instead I opted for the approach of highlighting a few memorable courses, for better or for worse, for what I took from them.   </p>  
      <p> My goal is to have a page for the course that i am awarding and all the work that went into it. This is going to be quite the feat to achieve over the course of the week but I think it will be more than worth it as im embarking on graduation. </p>
