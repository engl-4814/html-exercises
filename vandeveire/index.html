If youâ€™re recovering from a knee injury or surgery, a well-structured knee conditioning program can help you regain strength, flexibility, and range of motion. The following content are some key points to consider: </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-margin"> Strength Training: </h3>
            <p class="paragraph-indent"> Strengthening the muscles that support your knee is crucial. Strong muscles reduce stress on the knee joint and help absorb shock. Focus on the following muscle groups: </p> 
            <ul> 
                <li> <p> Hamstrings </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Quadtracepts </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Abductors & Adductors </p> </li>

                Those filenames should be revised to consider (1) more keyword-based words, (2) use hyphens rather than underscores, and (3) append the WxH values at the end
                - The alt value should be revised. Consider how there's no need to write "Picture of ..." Try to get to the crux of the photo, and write some good descriptive info that partners well with the source order of the content around the image.

                Some suggestions with this pattern.
                I think the h4 is a bit excessive in this case. This is an opinion, as it could be and h4. But, arguably you should be explaining and setting up this list with a paragraph before it. That said, here's some ideas to consider:
                    - After the h3, you need a intro paragraph.
                    - The h4s should be outside of the ols, and a paragraph should be after the h4, setting up the list.
                    - Then, the list is just that: A list with list items.
                    - Finally, the paragraphs aren't necessary in the lis

                <h4> Helcord Stretch: </h4>
                <li> <p> Stand facing a wall with your unaffected leg forward and a slight bend at the knee. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Your affected leg should be straight and behind you, heel flat and toes slightly pointed inward. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Press your hips forward toward the wall, keeping both heels flat on the floor. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, then relax for 30 seconds. Repeat. </p> </li>

            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> The ACL is one of the ligaments connecting the shinbone to the thighbone. ACL injuries often occur during sports that involve sudden changes in direction (e.g., basketball, soccer). </p>

            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> The bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can break due to falls or accidents. Osteoporosis can weaken bones, making them susceptible to fractures even from minor trauma. </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> 3. Torn Meniscus: </h4>
            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> The meniscus is rubbery cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between the shinbone and thighbone. Sudden twisting of the knee while bearing weight can tear the meniscus, leading to pain and limited mobility. </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubsection-indent"> 4. Sprained or Strained Knee Ligaments and Muscles: </h4>
            <p class = "paragraph-indent"> These injuries often result from trauma or overuse. Ligaments and muscles can become sprained or strained, causing pain, swelling, and instability. </p>
