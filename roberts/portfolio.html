                        <h3>English Department Poster</h3>
                            <p>Kayla designed this poster as part of her curriculum for a class she took titled "Visual Rhetoric and Document Design" during the Spring of 2024. This particular poster was created for an audience of creative minded individuals, and it is one in a set of 3 posters she created to promote the English department at Virginia Tech.</p>

                        <h3>English Typography Poster</h3>
                            <p>This poster comes from the same set as the first, but focuses on typography more so than imagery. By creating the two posters alongside each other, Kayla was able to compare the benefits of designing for both broad and concentrated audiences.</p>

                            <p>In addition to designing posters, Kayla designed this recipe book cover as part of a larger project where she also visually designed the book block for a book of 20 recipes. She curated the included images, colors, and even fonts to achieve the cozy feeling she had in mind for the project.</p>

                            <p>For the capstone class for Kayla's major in English Literature, she wrote a 16-page paper on the play titled "The Witch of Edmonton" for her final. The paper observes the play as a means of observing the dangers of social stasis and goes into special detail regarding the "Dog" character.</p>
