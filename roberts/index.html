		## Headings
			- Be careful about your heading level sequencing. Here's your structure right now:
				h2
						h4
						h4
						h4
					h3
						h4
						h4
						h4

			- Based on your existing content, as is below, it should be ...
				h1 More snappy title of your page or your name will do
				h2 Overview
					h3
					h3
				h2 Visual Introduction
				h2 About Me
					h3 Education
					h3 Experience
				h2 Contact Me

		## Landmark / Sectioning Elements
			- Note how you are currently only using the nav and footer elements to distinguish major landmarks of your page. Otherwise, you are using the generic div element to wrap everything else, when you should consider header, main, section, etc.
