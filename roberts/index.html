				I think the images in this section could actually work well later as part of your bio above. You could design a component that has your images on one side, and your bio on the other side. That said, you could create the following structure:

				- div class="bio_images"
					- img
					- img
				- div class="bio_text"
					- h2
					- p
					- CTA anchor (a) to help guide your readers to content that you'd like them to check out.
