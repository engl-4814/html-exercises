        Be sure to really test your site with the screenreader. All of these issues would have been caught with regular use of the tool.

        - main and footer are missing labels
        - nav menu label in the footer is a bit odd. Consider the content as a guide to write this value. In this case, it's social media links. I'd actually argue, however, that this isn't a nave menu, but simply an unordered list of links. Also, the nav is empty, and you're using a div, when the ul is sufficient here. ul, ol, and li selements are all blocks, so they don't need to be wrapped by a div, unless you're trying to bundle that ul with some more content.

        - The linked social media have aria-labels, but that's not needed here. Those should just be the content contained by the anchor (a). That's also sufficient for A11Y.

        - Throughout, the aria-labelledby technique needs thorough revision.
            1. the attribute on the banner isn't correct
            2. All of the values are incorrect. The value functions as a linked ID reference
            3. All of your sections need to have a role of region
