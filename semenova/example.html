    OVERALL FEEDBACK

    You gotta lot of copy/pasted code from the examples. I really suggest not doing that right now. I think you'll agree that your project is kinda messy right now, and I imagine it's hard to know where to revise, add things, subtract, change, etc. I highly recommend dedicating this week to starting it over from scratch. It sounds daunting, but you have ideas to draw upon, so you're not starting from scratch there.

    Be sure to use the resources from the readings + the handouts, such as the HTML Reference Guide. I think that'll help you develop your structure.

    Remember that we're focusing on big structure/landmarks, so most pages will include the following example with varied subparts within them of course.
  -->
  <a href =”#main” class=”skip-to-link”>Skip to content<a/>
  <header>
    <h1>Title of Page</h1>
    <!-- IMG? -->
  </header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">Page 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="">Page 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="">Page 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  <!-- The main content/sturcture will vary for you and everyone, so take this example with a grain of salt. -->
