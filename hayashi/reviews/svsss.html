      Some Thoughts on <em>Scum Villain Self-Saving System</em>

        Hoo boy, how to summarize this thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the main character, Shen Yuan, dies cursing out the unsatisfying ending of the online novel he was reading &lpar;it was pay per chapter&rpar; and wakes up in the role of the scum villain in the unsatisfying novel he was just cursing out. Hoping to avoid the terrible fate of the villain, he sets out to improve the treatment of the hero and &lpar;maybe&rpar; make some changes to the original novel along the way.
      </p>
      <section role="region" aria-labelledby="ending-spoilers">
        <h3 id="ending-spoilers">The ending, in case you wanted to know</h3>
        <p>
          Shen Yuan gets together with Luo Binghe, after realizing that Binghe is not plotting an elaborate revenge on him. The two do &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;it&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; in order to cure Binghe of his sickness caused by the evil sword they have, which gets out of control after successfully preventing Binghe's father from smashing the demon world and the human world together in an elaborate revenge plot &lpar;because of the apparent betrayal of Binghe's mother against Binghe's father.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's all very silly and makes very little sense when put like this &lpar;and honestly I can't really remember the full endings&rpar;. But trust me when I say it's a good ending.

        <h3 id="the-review">My thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          I had a blast with this book, BUT I went into this expecting comedy. &lpar;A lot of people didn't seem to like this book, but I don't think they expected comedy. Or maybe they didn't know enough about the Chinese light novel scene.&rpar; The tone of this book is super different from the author's two other books. &lpar;But it has been pointed out that they cover the same heavy topics as her two other books, it's just hidden under the narrator's absolutely ridiculous perspective on everything.&rpar;
        </p>
        <p>
          I somehow didn't end up quite as deep in this fandom as I did in MDZS, but that might be because I was mostly invested in the main couple and the fanfic on them was not as much as the Lan Zhan/Wei Ying fanfic. 
        </p>
        <p>Or maybe I'm just not as invested in books as I used to. The SVSSS adaptations are very small and only include the officially translated novels and one &lpar;1&rpar; season of an donghua that most people didn't like.</p>
        <p>
          &lpar;I quite liked the donghua because it really leaned into the video game style of the novel, then I watched &lpar;some of&rpar; <em>Thousand Autumns</em> and found out that the donghua style is also done unironically, and I don't think I can take any donghua done in that style seriously anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          This novel also is the only one of the author's books that feature a side couple, but before you get your hopes up, the side couple are only together in the novel extras.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time in the fandom, the side couple are probably more hilarious than the actual couple, so let me devote some words to them.
        </p>
        <h3>The Side Couple</h3>
        <p>
          The side couple are composed of a demon lord named Mobei Jun and the transmigrated author, who ended up in the body of a guy named Shang Qinghua.
        </p>
        <p>
          The readers never find out what the author was actually named IRL because Shen Yuan and Shang Qinghua &lpar;if you find the names confusing, then you're not alone. It took me ages to be able to say the right name with some confidence&rpar; But Shang Qinghua is also know as &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Airplane Shooting Toward the Sky&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; because that was his pen name.
        </p>
        <p>
          But anyway, Shang Qinghua - the original one - was a spy for the demons and was killed early &lpar;by the demons, for being a spy&rpar; so obviously the author doesn't want to be killed in his own novel and works to ingratiate himself with the demon king he's spying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's very much an &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;opposites attract&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; situation because Mobei Jun is very taciturn and would rather gesture than talk and Shang Qinghua is amazing in his ability to just verbally vomit until someone tells him to shut up.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a lot of fanfic devoted to them starting a relationship but between Shang Qinghua's complete terror of Mobei Jun and Mobei Jun's complete inability to use his words, Shang Qinghua doesn't realize that they are in a relationship, which is very much along the same vibes as the entire book.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>END OF ASIDE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          But I enjoyed the slander against novels that follow the same predictable formula, which is coached in very Chinese terms. Fortunately the official translation has footnotes for the more modern Chinese things that don't translate well into English.
        </p>
        <p>
          I read all four books in like two days or so, which was such a wild ride, but I did find the ending slightly anticlimatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I was surprised by the ending because I expected it to have an entire novel more and the third book pretty much wrapped up the plot points, so when I opened the fourth book, I was extremely surprised by the extras. It's kind of like expecting the rollercoaster to go on for another ten minutes, and then you're pulling into the end of the ride. SO while the extras were interesting, they weren't a substitute for substantial plot, so that's probably why I was disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this series was great, but thankfully I wasn't absolutely consumed by the pressing need to read more fanfic, which was nice because I had homework to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe someday I'll finish <em>Heaven Official's Blessing</em>, but it's way longer than either MDZS or SVSSS.

      <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
      <p>I don't do horror or thriller. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
