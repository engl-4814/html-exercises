      <p>The rise and fall of a famous, fictional rock band, as told by the band members and their associates after the fact.</p>
      <p>Featuring a lot of drugs, bad communication, self-absorbed humans, hard drugs, and &lpar;very briefly&rpar; the Vietnam War.</p>

        <h3 id="ending-spoilers">The ending, in case you wanted to know</h3>
        <p>I have no clue. I haven't finished this book yet.</p>

        <h3 id="the-review">My thoughts</h3>
        <p>This is a raging trashfire, and it almost ended me to finish it. I mean, any book that's premised off a rock band in the 70s, with Vietnam War and hippies and whatever &lpar;and the band is inspired by Fleetwood Mac, not that I know anything about Fleetwood Mac&rpar; is probably going to be not quite something I'm interested it. But I read it for book club - am technically still reading it - and holy moly I didn't realize there were so many types of drugs in the world.</p>
        <p>Once Billy &lpar;the lead singer&rpar; and Daisy &lpar;the other lead, but not actually part of the Six because she joined later&rpar; met I allocated a good portion of my brain worrying that Billy was going to cheat on his long-suffering wife with Daisy.</p>
        <p>I'm just saying, if you're going to get married, then stay interested in your spouse! &lpar;Unless your spouse sucks, but that's a totally different plotline and Billy is the sucky spouse. His wife should've divorced him&rpar;</p>
        <p>Honestly the only thing that saved this book for me was the fact that it was in interview format because it was slightly more interesting. Hindsight is 20-20 and all that.</p>

    <h2 id="personal-information">About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
    <p>I don't do horror or thrillers. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
