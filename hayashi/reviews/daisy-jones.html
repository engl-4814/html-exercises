      <p>The rise and fall of a famous, fictional rock band, as told by the band members and their associates after the fact.</p>
      <p>Featuring a lot of drugs, bad communication, self-absorbed humans, hard drugs, and &lpar;very briefly&rpar; the Vietnam War.</p>
      <section role="region" aria-labelledby="ending-spoilers">
        <h3 id="ending-spoilers">The ending, in case you wanted to know</h3>
        <p>
          The &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;;big&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;; breakup was pretty anticlimatic. What happened was the band released a big album and were on tour &lpar;as you do when your album is very popular&rpar; and Billy and Diasy made some intense eye-contact until they hit the &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;oh no, i like him/her except he/she is unavailable because he/she is married&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Billy's wife realizes that they know they're in lust with each other and sits Daisy down and basically kicks her out of the band because only she gets to have Billy. So Daisy leaves halfway through tour in the middle of the night and only leaves a lousy note. And that's the end of the band because their other lead singer left.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also turned out that the interviewer was Billy's kid, which was kind of surprising but also not really. Everyone pretty much straightened out and now they're living their second-best lives &lpar;presumably being a famous rock star was the first&rpar; and Billy's wife is dead and he still misses her.

        <h3 id="the-review">My thoughts</h3>
        <p>This is a raging trashfire, and it almost ended me to finish it. I mean, any book that's premised off a rock band in the 70s, with Vietnam War and hippies and whatever &lpar;and the band is inspired by Fleetwood Mac, not that I know anything about Fleetwood Mac&rpar; is probably going to be not quite something I'm interested it. But I read it for book club - am technically still reading it - and holy moly I didn't realize there were so many types of drugs in the world.</p>
        <p>Once Billy &lpar;the lead singer&rpar; and Daisy &lpar;the other lead, but not actually part of the Six because she joined later&rpar; met I allocated a good portion of my brain worrying that Billy was going to cheat on his long-suffering wife with Daisy.</p>
        <p>
          I'm just saying, if you're going to get married, then stay interested in your spouse! &lpar;Unless your spouse sucks, but that's a totally different plotline and Billy is the sucky spouse. His wife should've divorced him&rpar;
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly the only thing that saved this book for me was the fact that it was in interview format because it was slightly more interesting. Hindsight is 20-20 and all that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at least there was no cheating and Daisy managed to not die from a drug overdose, although her taste in men is horrific. So maybe this gets an okay from me. I probably need to like Fleetwood Mac &lpar;or know anything about them aside from, vaguely, that they sing&rpar; to really enjoy this book. But people in my book club rather liked it, even though we didn't have much to say about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It sounds like the show is rather different from the book, but not horrifically so. I won't be watching it. The book was enough. I don't think I could take the live drama of it.

    <div>
      <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
      <p>I don't do horror or thriller. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
