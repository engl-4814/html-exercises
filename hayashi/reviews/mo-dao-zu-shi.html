        <h3 id="ending-spoilers">The ending, in case you wanted to know</h3>
        <p>Wei Wuxian confesses his love to Lan Wangji, courtesy Zhan. &lparThis is good because we, the viewers, and Wei Wuxian's wider circle of acquaintances have been waiting for them to get together for years.&rpar; Unfortunately, his timing sucks because they - Wei Wuxian, Wei Wuxian's brother and nephew, Nie Huaisang, Lan Wangji, Lan Wanji's brother, and a couple junior disciples of the Lan sect - are currently being held hostage by Jin Guanyao and Su She.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the happy ending of this story, Jin Guanyao and Su She are defeated with the help of the resentful corpse from earlier and everyone is freed from the PDA because Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian dip as soon as the dust dies down.</p>   
        <p>There's other stuff, but that's the basic ending. Some spoilers are too good to be actually spoiled.</p>

        <h3 id="the-review">My thoughts</h3>
        <p>Weirdly, for me, this is actually a zombie story, which I normally don't do. I, however, didn't figure this out until I started watching the live action &lpar;which I stalled on at the fourth episode or so and never picked up again&rpar; and this is probably why I never finished it.</p>
        <p>But I caught Covid in Fall 2023 and needed something low-key for my fevered brain to latch onto, so I started watching the donghua. And then reading the manhua because this story is unfortunately both very interesting and has an enormous fandom, so here I am, nearly six months later, still buried in this obsession.</p>
        <p>As an alert reader might guess, I really enjoyed this, tears and all.</p>

    <h2 id="personal-information">About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
    <p>I don't do horror or thrillers. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
