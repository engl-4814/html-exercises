        Wei Ying, courtesy Wuxian, former practitioner of heretical cultivation &lpar;magic&rpar;, is summoned 13 years &lpar;or 16, depending on which version you watch&rpar; after his death because the summoner wants revenge and is willing to literally destroy himself for it. He teams up with his ex...something &lpar;reliable sources tell me this "something" is the other half of the main ship&rpar; to solve the mystery of the extremely vengeful body parts he encounters almost immediately after being summoned, all while dealing with his suitably tragic backstory and his extremely low self-esteem.

        <h3 id="ending-spoilers">The ending, in case you wanted to know</h3>
        <p>
          Wei Wuxian confesses his love to Lan Wangji, courtesy Zhan. &lpar;This is good because we, the viewers, and Wei Wuxian's wider circle of acquaintances have been waiting for them to get together for years. Minus the thirteen to sixteen that Wei Wuxian was dead for.&rpar; Unfortunately, his timing sucks because they - Wei Wuxian, Wei Wuxian's brother and nephew, Nie Huaisang, Lan Wangji, Lan Wanji's brother, and a couple junior disciples of the Lan sect - are currently being held hostage by Jin Guanyao and Su She.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately for the happy ending of this story, Jin Guanyao and Su She are defeated with the help of the resentful corpse from earlier and everyone is freed from the PDA because Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian elope as soon as the dust dies down.
        </p>   
        <p>
          There's other stuff, but that's the basic ending. Some spoilers are too good to be actually spoiled.

        <h3 id="the-review">My thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Weirdly, for me, this is actually a zombie story, which I normally don't do. I, however, didn't figure this out until I started watching the live action &lpar;which I stalled on at the fourth episode or so and never picked up again&rpar; and this is probably why I never finished it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I caught Covid in the fall 2023 semester and needed something low-key for my fevered brain to latch onto, so I started watching the donghua. And then reading the manhua because this story is unfortunately both very interesting and has an enormous fandom, so here I am, nearly six months later, still buried in this obsession.
        </p>
        <p>As an alert reader might guess, I really enjoyed this, tears and all.</p>
        <p>
          The live action is much different than the other stories, but generally fans accept it despite the lack of relationships, particularly the main one between Wei Ying &lpar;courtesy Wuxian&rpar; and Lan Zhan &lpar;courtesy Wangji&rpar;. Personally, I didn't drop the live action because of the lack of romance but because the entire story is basically a tragedy disguised by the fact that the post-summoning stuff is basically a buddy cop show &lpar; as one clever person on a wangxian tumblr blog described it&rpar;. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The past is just really tragic and honestly the reason I'm still neck-deep in this fandom is because of all the fantastic fanfic out there, which mostly focus on the happy fluff and not the tragic death and darkness. And pretty much everyone is on board the Wangxian ship, so there's so much stuff I can read, not all of it poorly written.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also a miscommunication love story, where one half is convinced the other half hates him even though they're both ridiculously in love, but if they did realize their feelings earlier, there would definitely be 100% more secondhand embarassment than there already is, so maybe it's better that Wuxian is oblivious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The courtesy names are absurdly difficult to remember, and it basically means everyone has three names, so I'm honestly impressed I know so many people's names by now. I blame it on the fanfic because before that, I knew the little group of kids that followed Wuxian and Lan Zhan around as &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;ducklings&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; because that's what Wuxian called them. But now I know they have distinct characteristics, so there's that I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of this is just watching how someone can stand for justice and peace above everything else and be vindicated in the long run, which is probably the appeal of the show, and also watching someone who has been treated horribly drive everyone up the wall by being a genius chaos gremlin is hilarious and hugely satisfying.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a sort of universal appeal, I think, which is why this show is so much more popular than the others by the same author &lpar;although her two other books are also pretty popular in America&rpar;
        </p>
        <p>
          The other two books, <em>Scum Villian's Self-Saving System</em> &lpar;SVSSS&rpar; and <em>Heaven Official's Blessing</em> &lpar;TGCF because the acronym is based on the Chinese name for some reason&rpar;, are also gay, which might be why it's so hard to get more adaptations for them. But SVSSS is basically a crackfic about a highly niche area of Chinese novels, which makes it a little hard to export to America, even though it could be summarized as a story about the trials fans go through when their author does things they don't like for the money.
        </p>
        <p>
          TGCF is just long. Like twice as long as MDZS, which is quite a feat actually, and also &lpar;as far as I can tell. I haven't finished it yet because only the novel is done&rpar; more serious and dark than MDZS &lpar;another feat considering that MDZS is about raising zombies and murdering entire clans&rpar;.
        </p>
        <p>
          But MDZS is more about public reputations, I think and TGCF is more about personal struggles with mental health and history.

      <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
      <p>I don't do horror or thriller. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
