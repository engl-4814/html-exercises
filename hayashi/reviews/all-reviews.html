          <p> So I caught Covid in the fall 2023 semester and needed something low-key for my fevered brain to latch onto and started watching the donghua for this. And then I started reading the manhua because this story is unfortunately both very interesting and has an enormous fandom, so here I am, nearly six months later, still buried in this obsession.</p>

          <p>This is a raging trashfire, and it almost ended me to finish it. I mean, any book that's premised off a rock band in the 70s, with Vietnam War and hippies and whatever &lpar;and the band is inspired by Fleetwood Mac, not that I know anything about Fleetwood Mac&rpar; is probably going to be not quite something I'm interested it. But I read it for book club - am technically still reading it - and holy moly I didn't realize there were so many types of drugs in the world.</p>

    <h2 id="personal-information">About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
    <p>I don't do horror or thriller. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
