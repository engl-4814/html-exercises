          <p>I should probably preface this by saying that I haven't read much manhua, so as far as I can tell, the style is less distinct in my head than manga or manhwa.</p>

          <p>The main place I've been reading fanfiction is Archive of Our Own, and it's mostly <a href="./../reviews/mo-dao-zu-shi.html">The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation's</a> fault because there are just so many fics in that fandom.</p>

    <div>
      <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
      <p>I don't do horror or thriller. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
