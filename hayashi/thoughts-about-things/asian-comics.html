    <article role="region">
      <p>
        I should probably preface this by saying that I haven't read much manhua, so as far as I can tell, the style is less distinct in my head than manga or manhwa.

      <section role="region" aria-labelledby="similarities-between-asian-comics">
        <h3 id="similarities-between-asian-comics">Similarities</h3>
        <p>
          One similarity is that they're all very stylized, and characters tend to have the big eyes and high cheekbones. Visually they're honestly pretty similar, but even so there's some differences that you can find. &lpar;I wrote an entire essay about manhwa and manga that I sent out in a newsletter one time about the differences that you can find just by looking at shirtles men because tons of readers are just thirsty single girls. Technically I'm one of them, but I'm not always interested in ogling really ripped, shirtless men. I go more for the eyes, which have plenty of great shots&rpar;
        </p>
        <p>
          Another is that the words tend to be much bigger than in American comics, almost universally &lpar;unless you're reading pirated fan translations, which we absolutely aren't, wink wink nudge nudge&rpar;. The words are also much more separated out, in big speech bubbles with margins and stuff, which might be the norm, but not for the American comics I read so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          They're also largely web-based, and although manga has a huge print following, manhwa especially is online and set up in a vertical format instead of page to page. You can read it page by page sometimes, but it's designed for scrolling.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section role="region" aria-labelledby="differences-between-asian-comics">
        <h3 id="differences-between-asian-comics">Differences</h3>
        <p>
          The obvious difference is that one is Japanese &lpar;manga&rpar;, one is Korean &lpar;manhwa&rpar;, and one is Chinese &lpar;manhua&rpar;, with all the different cultural things that goes with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visually, manga is normall black and white, while Korean is color. The few manhua I've read are probably less saturated colors than manhwa, which could just be the different author styles. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Manga does less flowers and sparkles when showing people. They tend to go for the full body close ups, which manhwa also does. The difference is that manhwa, especially the romance ones, add sparkles and framing to clue the reader in that it's the guy you're supposed to be rooting for, and look, he &lpar;or she&rpar; is really handsome. Manhua leans more like manga than manhwa, except it's almost unnaturally pretty. I mean, look at Hua Cheng and Xie Lan! Look how pretty they are compared to the other types!
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly, that's not the pretties manhwa can get, but I like Pereshati, and My In-Laws are Obsessed with Me recently returned from hiatus, so that's what you get. Go read My In-Laws are Obsessed with Me! It's great.
        </p>
        <p>
          One really pretty manhwa is The Stepmother's Fairy Tale, or Fantasie of a Stepmother &lpar;below&rpar;, which is gorgeous. It's differently pretty than TGCF, but it's still pretty. Fantasie is more about the light and shadow and TGCF is just flowy almost-realism.

        Probably this isn't helping you tell the difference between the three, but honestly they're all pretty great so you don't have to strictly stick to one or the other. I personally read all over the place without getting too hung up on which one it is. But when you look for recommendations similar to ones you really like, you'll probably end up with ones from the same country because they're so similar.

    <h2 id="personal-information">About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
    <p>I don't do horror or thriller. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
