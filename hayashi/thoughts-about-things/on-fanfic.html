          The main place I've been reading fanfiction is Archive of Our Own, and it's mostly <a href="./../reviews/mo-dao-zu-shi.html">The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation's</a> fault because there are just so many fics in that fandom. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But I feel like fanfiction is generally better than expected even though some of them really need a copyeditor to fix the bad grammar. The only reason I wasn't reading more fanfiction is because my fandoms are tiny, and the ones that are big &lpar;like The Goblin Emperor&rpar; had weird pairings I didn't like. Also I need to really enjoy a story to want to read fanfiction on it, which is actually pretty rare, considering the amount of books I read.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I think that it shouldn't be so stimatized to like reading fanfiction, especially after spending the last four months buried in AO3. Some of the stuff is pretty good, and while the authors are taking already established characters and using them, if you changed the names, you could probably get a story that could stand pretty well by itself. Some of them are involved and longer and better than actual published books.

    <h2 id="personal-information">About me!</h2>
    <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
    <p>I don't do horror or thrillers. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
