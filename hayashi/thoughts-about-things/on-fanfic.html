        <p>
          The main place I've been reading fanfiction is Archive of Our Own, and it's mostly <a href="./../reviews/mo-dao-zu-shi.html"><em>The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation</em>'s</a> fault because there are just so many fics in that fandom. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel like fanfiction is generally better than expected even though some of them really need a copyeditor to fix the bad grammar. &lpar;Short Rant: Authors needs to stop using the phrase &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;rein oneself in&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; because they use &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;reign,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; and I've become inured to it so now I do a double take when I see the correct phrase and I am not here for it. Also, I think some people think it means something along the lines of using self control, and I feel like it's more for exerting control over someone or something else, like pulling in strong emotions so that they're not showing. So not only are they regularly mispelling it, they aren't using it correctly. But anyway.&rpar; The only reason I wasn't reading more fanfiction is because my fandoms are tiny, and the ones that are big &lpar;like <em>The Goblin Emperor</em>&rpar; had weird pairings I didn't like. Also I need to really enjoy a story to want to read fanfiction on it, which is actually pretty rare, considering the amount of books I read.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I think that it shouldn't be so stigmatized to like reading fanfiction, especially after spending the last four months buried in AO3. Some of the stuff is pretty good, and while the authors are taking already established characters and using them, if you changed the names, you could probably get a story that could stand pretty well by itself. Some of them are involved, and some are longer and better than actual published books.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance one of my favorite fics is &lpar;back to <em>The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation</em>&rpar; &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Come Around and Stay&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; &lpar;which potentially is long enough to be a published novel&rpar;. It explores trauma in a way that is not really covered by the original, and I might actually like it better than <em>The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation</em> because there's so much less tragedy. The fic focuses on moving past all the hurt whereas the original is about the tragedy itself
        </p>
        <p>
          &lpar;I also like it because Wei Wuxian has a proper support network AND reconciles with his brother, but that's neither here nor there.&rpar;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the point remains that there are some really good fics out there, even if the fandom you're a part of doesn't have a lot of fics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do acknowledge that the fandom has to be properly huge in order to get quite that many fics, and as a niche book reader, I also acknowledge the pain of finding a really good book and having nowhere to bring you're enthusiasm.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then again, sometimes it <em>is</em> nicer to not know what strange ideas fans are coming up with about a series you like.

    <div>
      <p>I'm the Devourer of Books. I prefer fantasy books, but sometimes I branch out to other things. Original inhabitant of Hawaii, though currently based in Virginia. I've been reading books for about 15 years or so - since I was literate - and Asian comics since high school.</p>
      <p>I don't do horror or thriller. Preferred genres are fantasy and fiction, preferably young adult but as non-angsty as possible because I have read way too many love triangles in my time.</p>
