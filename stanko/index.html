                    <p>Hi, I'm Kate. Welcome to my corner of creativity! As a rising senior at Virginia Tech pursuing a double major in Professional & Technical Writing and Communication, I find immense joy in exploring various forms of expression, from penning down compelling narratives to curating captivating visual designs.

                    <p>My professional experiences, ranging from internships in technical writing for Virginia Tech's Department of IT to crafting media content for government communications in Chesterfield County, have honed my ability to communicate effectively across diverse audiences. I thrive in environments where innovation meets communication, striving to create impactful solutions through meticulous attention to detail and clear, concise messaging.</p>
                    <p>
                       Beyond academia and professional endeavors, I'm an active member of the community, serving as the previous FM Program Director for WUVT-FM 90.7 Blacksburg and now current General Manager as well as coaching public speaking at Virginia Tech's CommLab. These roles not only enrich my leadership skills but also foster a deep sense of connection with fellow enthusiasts of communication and expression.
                    </p>                        
                    In my spare time, you'll find me immersed in a world of melodies as a Student DJ at WUVT-FM 90.7 Blacksburg or unleashing my creativity through drawing and writing. Whether it's crafting the perfect playlist or weaving narratives that captivate the imagination, I'm constantly inspired by the power of creativity to connect and inspire.</p>
